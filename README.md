# Dungeon Champions

This is an addon script for the PC / Mac game [Elder Scrolls Online](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/)

This addon shows bosses in public and standard delve dungeons only, group dungeons aren't added because of the way achievements work on veteran dungeons.

In the settings you can enable showing both killed and not yet killed bosses.
With the default setting all already killed bosses have a green icon, bosses you haven't killed yet have a red icon.

Current version has English, German, French and Russian translations.

Slash command `/dc_mypos` prints coordinates of your current location to the chat.
